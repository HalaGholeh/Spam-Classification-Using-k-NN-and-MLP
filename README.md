# Spam Classification Using k-NN and MLP

This repository contains a Python script for classifying spam emails using two different machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

## Overview

The script performs the following steps:
1. Loads and preprocesses the spam dataset.
2. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trains a k-NN model and evaluates its performance.
4. Trains an MLP model and evaluates its performance.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
